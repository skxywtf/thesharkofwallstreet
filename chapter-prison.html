    <article class="story-text">

      <p class="drop-cap">The concrete walls of Unit D didn’t just hold the heat; they magnified it, baking the three hundred men stacked inside like meat in a pressure cooker. It was the kind of heat that made the air thick and hard to swallow, tasting of bleach, black mold, and the sour, fermented sweat of men who had nowhere to run. I lay on the top bunk, staring at a water stain on the ceiling that looked like a map of a country that didn't exist. My legs were cramping, a dull ache that wouldn't go away, but I didn't move. In here, movement attracted attention, and attention was the most dangerous currency you could hold.</p>

      <p>Below me, the springs groaned. Doom was awake. He was always awake. I wasn’t sure the man actually slept; he just entered a state of low-power observation, like a reptile waiting on a rock.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"You're breathing too loud, India,"</p>

      <p>Doom rasped. His voice sounded like gravel being crushed under a boot. "You sound like a radiator about to blow."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"It's the heat,"</p>

      <p>I whispered, keeping my eyes on the stain.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"It ain't the heat,"</p>

      <p>Doom said, flipping a page of his book. The sound was sharp in the heavy silence of the cell. "It’s the waiting. The waiting is what eats you. The fight happens in ten minutes or ten years, it don't matter. You're already fighting it in your head, burning up energy you’re gonna need."</p>

      <p>I rolled over and looked over the edge. Doom was lying on his back, holding a tattered paperback with a cover so worn the title was gone. He was an ancient thing, carved out of the prison itself. His skin was the color of old mahogany, tough and scarred, and his eyes were black pits that absorbed the light. He’d been in here since before the internet, before cell phones, before the world outside had sped up and left this place behind. He called me India because on my first day, when the intake guard asked where I was from, I’d mumbled something about not belonging here, and Doom had said, <em>'You look like you're lost in a foreign country, kid. You look like India.'</em> The name stuck. Names always stuck in here. They were the only things you truly owned.</p>

        <img src="doom.png" alt="Doom" style="width: 100%; display: block;">
      </div>

      <p class="dialogue">"He was watching me in the yard again,"</p>

      <p>I said, the words tasting like ash.</p>

      <p>Doom finally lowered the book. "Grunt watches everything. He’s a shark in a goldfish bowl. He’s gotta keep moving, keep scaring people, or he remembers he’s just another number in a cage."</p>

      <p><strong>Grunt.</strong> The name was a joke that wasn't funny. He was a creature of pure intimidation, a towering slab of muscle that stood six-foot-five and blocked out the sun. He wasn't just big; he was dense, packed with the kind of violence that felt inevitable. His head was shaved clean, shining under the yard lights, and his skin was a tapestry of prison ink—jagged tribal bands, skulls, weeping angels, and words written in script too fancy for the violence they promised. He had a silver ring through his septum like a bull, and when he breathed, you could hear the air whistling through it.</p>

      <p>We spent the next hour in silence, the kind of silence that screams. I paced the cell, three steps forward, three steps back. Doom polished his boots. He had a way of making the mundane look like a ritual. Every swipe of the rag was precise. He was teaching me, even when he wasn't talking. <em>Focus on the small thing. Control what you can touch.</em></p>
