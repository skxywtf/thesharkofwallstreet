    <article class="story-text">
      <p class="drop-cap">Bone met cartilage. It wasn't the cinematic crack of a movie fight. It was a wet, muffled thud, like a sledgehammer hitting a bag of wet sand. My forearm connected with Grunt’s throat just as his body weight shifted forward. It was simple mechanics. He was a freight train; I was a derailed track.</p>

      <p>Grunt’s eyes went wide. The pupils, pinpricks of rage a second ago, suddenly dilated in panic. The oxygen cut off instantly.</p>

      <p>He gagged—a horrible, guttural sound that strangled in his throat. His hands flew to his neck, abandoning the attack, abandoning defense, abandoning everything but the desperate need for air.</p>

      <p>But the physics weren't done with him yet.</p>

      <p>He tried to backpedal, to get away from the source of the pain, but the floor was still slick with soap and condensation. His heavy combat boots, which had given him so much traction when he was charging, now became skates. His heel caught a puddle.</p>

      <p><em>Fulcrum. Leverage. Gravity.</em></p>

      <p>Three hundred pounds of muscle went horizontal. He hit the concrete floor with a force that shook the dryers. His head bounced once—a hollow <em>thwack</em> against the cement—and then he lay still, wheezing, clutching his throat, his legs twitching involuntarily.</p>

      <p>The laundry room went dead silent. Even the machines seemed to hold their breath.</p>

      <p>I stood over him, my chest heaving, my forearm throbbing where I’d made contact. The adrenaline was screaming in my blood, a high-pitched whine that drowned out the world. I looked at my hands. They were shaking again, but not from fear this time. From the surge.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Enough,"</p>

      <p>Doom’s voice cut through the haze. He was at my side instantly, his hand gripping my shoulder. "Don't kick him. Don't look at the crowd. Walk away."</p>

      <p>"He's not moving," I whispered. The reality of what I’d done was crashing in. I wasn’t a fighter. I was a quant. I dealt in risk analysis, not blunt force trauma.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"He'll move when the air comes back,"</p>

      <p>Doom said, steering me toward the exit. "You broke his wind, not his neck. Now move. Before the shock wears off and his boys remember they outnumber us twenty to two."</p>

      <div style="margin: 4rem 0; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1);">
        <img src="aftermath.png" alt="Walking Away" style="width: 100%; display: block;">
      </div>

      <p>We walked through the circle. The wall of men parted. They didn't jeer. They didn't cheer. They just stared. I saw confusion in their faces. They had come to see a slaughter, and they had seen a math problem solved in real-time. The Aryan crew looked at Grunt, gasping on the floor like a fish out of water, and then they looked at me. The predator had become the prey.</p>

      <p>Miller, the guard, was leaning against the doorframe, chewing on a toothpick. He looked at Grunt, then at me. He didn't blow his whistle. He didn't call for backup.</p>

      <p>"Slip and fall?" Miller asked, his eyes bored.</p>

      <p>"Floor's wet, boss," Doom said, not breaking stride. "OSHA violation waiting to happen."</p>

      <p>Miller grunted and stepped aside.</p>

      <hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); margin: 3rem 0;">

      <p>Back in the cell, the crash came. My legs turned to water, and I sat heavily on the bottom bunk. The smell of the laundry room—that chemical lemon and fear—was still stuck in my nose.</p>

      <p>Doom sat on the edge of his bunk, looking at me with that same unreadable expression. He didn't offer praise. He didn't smile.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"You bought time,"</p>

      <p>he said softly, picking up his book again. "But the interest rate in here is high. Grunt won't come at you straight again. He'll come sideways. He'll come when you're sleeping, or when you're on the toilet, or when you're thinking about home."</p>

      <p>"So what do I do?" I asked, wiping the sweat from my forehead.</p>

      <p>Doom opened his book to the dog-eared page. He didn't look up.</p>

      <p>"You keep solving the physics, India. You keep solving the physics."</p>
