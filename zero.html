      <div class="status-header">Part I: The Void State<br>Altitude: 45,000 ft</div>
    <div class="story-media">
      <img src="z9.png" alt="Silhouette in Vantablack suit">
    </div>
      <p class="drop-cap">The Gulfstream G650 was a silver bullet screaming through the stratosphere at Mach 0.9. Inside, the cabin was a pressurized tube of cream leather and silence.</p>

      <p>Viktor Kovacs sat in the mid-cabin, swirling a glass of vodka. He was celebrating. The dirty bomb algorithm had been transferred. The eighty million in crypto was verified. He was untouchable.</p>
    <div class="story-media">
      <img src="z1.png" alt="Silhouette in Vantablack suit">
    </div>
      <p class="dialogue">"More ice, Mr. Kovacs?"</p>

      <p>Viktor looked up. Elena, the flight attendant, stood over him. She wasn't wearing the standard drab corporate gray. She wore a striking crimson skirt and a white blouse with red trim, her blonde hair falling in loose waves under a red pillbox hat. White gloves gripped the silver ice tongs.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Please,"</p>

      <p>Kovacs said. He watched her work, then glanced toward the rear of the plane. "And check on Grigori. If he sleeps any deeper, he’ll stop breathing."</p>

      <p>Elena glanced back at the jump seat where Grigori, Kovacs's massive bodyguard, was slumped against the bulkhead. "I’ll see if he needs water," she said softly.</p>

      <p>She turned and walked down the aisle. But as she passed the mid-cabin divider, her step faltered. She stopped.</p>

      <p>Her attention had been snagged by something in the furthest seat—a shadow that seemed to pool deeper than the lighting design allowed.</p>
    <div class="story-media">
      <img src="z2.png" alt="Silhouette in Vantablack suit">
    </div>
      <p>A man was sitting there. A passenger Kovacs didn't remember inviting.</p>

      <p>He was dressed in a suit of matte-black fabric that drank the ambient light. He sat perfectly still, staring out the darkened porthole at the curvature of the earth.</p>

      <p>Elena walked toward him, not with the professional gait of a stewardess, but with the slow, magnetic drift of a moth circling a flame. The air around the stranger seemed to drop ten degrees.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Can I get you anything?"</p>

      <p>Elena whispered. Her voice was husky, trembling with a strange vibration. She leaned over him, her white gloved hand resting on the leather headrest.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Fuel is for the living,"</p>

      <p>the figure said. His voice was a smooth baritone that seemed to resonate in the glass of the windows.</p>

      <p>Elena didn't recoil. She leaned closer. The danger radiating off him wasn't a warning; it was a hypnotic pull. She reached out, her white glove trailing down the black collar of his jacket.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"And what are you?"</p>

      <p>The figure turned. His face was obscured by a ballistic mask and dark eyewear, but the angle of his jaw was sharp, predatory.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"I am the end of the line,"</p>

      <p>he whispered.</p>

      <p>Elena smiled—a slow, intoxicated expression of absolute surrender. She moved her hand to his masked face. She didn't pull away. She leaned in, drawn by a gravity she couldn't resist, and pressed her lips against his.</p>

      <div class="story-media">
        <img src="z4.png" alt="Elena the flight attendant kissing Zero in the jet cabin">
      </div>
      <p>It was a kiss of terrifying intimacy. Classy, quiet, and cold.</p>

      <p>Kovacs watched, frozen in his seat, unable to process the scene.</p>

      <p>Elena pulled back, breathless, her eyes wide and euphoric. "Beautiful," she breathed.</p>

      <p>And then, she blinked.</p>

      <p>In the fraction of a second it took for her eyelids to reopen, she didn't fall. She didn't faint. She <strong>ceased</strong>.</p>

      <p>One second she was flushed and alive. The next, the air where she stood collapsed with a soft <em>thrum</em>. No body. No uniform. Just empty space. <em>Clink.</em> The ice tongs she had been holding hit the floor.</p>

      <p>Kovacs jumped up, spilling his vodka. "Elena?"</p>

      <p>He looked at the rear seat. The dark figure stood up. The shadows fell away, revealing the mask of smooth, featureless ballistic glass.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"She was a variable,"</p>

      <p>the voice said, stripping itself of the smooth baritone, flattening into the digital, frequency-less voice of <strong>Zero</strong>. "I removed her."</p>

      <p>Kovacs scrambled backward. "Grigori! Wake up! Kill him!"</p>

      <p>Grigori didn't move.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Grigori was deleted four minutes ago."</p>

      <p>Kovacs looked at the jump seat. It was empty. Pristine leather. Seatbelt buckled. No warmth.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Who are you?"</p>

      <p>Kovacs screamed, backing against the cockpit door.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Zero sum,"</p>

      <p>the figure whispered. He placed a gloved hand on Kovacs’ chest. It wasn't a strike. It was a deletion.</p>

    <div class="story-media">
      <img src="z8.png" alt="Silhouette in Vantablack suit">
    </div>
      <div class="status-header">Part II: The Zero Breach<br>Obsidian Tower, 98th Floor</div>

      <div class="story-media">
        <img src="z10.png" alt="Zero clinging to the side of a skyscraper at night">
      </div>

      <p>Four hours later. The wind at 1,400 feet didn't just blow; it screamed. It tore at the corners of the building, trying to scrub anything organic off the face of the glass.</p>

      <p><strong>Zero</strong> didn't feel it.</p>

      <p>He hung suspended four hundred meters above the streets of Manhattan, a shadow clinging to a monolith. He was mag-locked to the sheer glass face of the Obsidian Tower. Inside, on the 98th floor, lay <strong>The Ledger Chip</strong>—the stolen hardware containing The Shark’s private keys.</p>

      <p>Zero raised his right hand. The <strong>Arc Cutter</strong> extended from his wrist gauntlet, glowing with a cold, electric-blue light.</p>

      <p>He pressed the tip against the reinforced storm glass. There was no screech. Just the hiss of molecular bonds being unzipped. The blue light traced a perfect circle. Zero engaged a suction grip, caught the glass before it could fall, and slipped inside.</p>

      <p>The server room was a canyon of humming black monoliths. Zero didn't walk; he flowed. He reached the central terminal. There it was. The Ledger Chip, sitting in a physical isolation dock.</p>
      <div class="story-media">
        <img src="z3.png" alt="Elena the flight attendant kissing Zero in the jet cabin">
      </div>
      <p>He reached out. His glove, lined with a localized EMP mesh, plucked the chip from the magnetic field. He slid the chip into a shielded pouch on his chest.</p>

      <p>He turned to leave.</p>

      <p><em>Click.</em></p>

      <p>The magnetic field hadn't just been holding the chip; it had been completing a circuit. The moment the mass was removed, the resistance changed. <strong>ALARM.</strong></p>


      <p>Red strobes detonated. A Klaxon wailed. <em>Blast shields deploying.</em> Zero sprinted for the window—his exit. But he was too slow. Heavy titanium shutters slammed down over the glass he had just cut, sealing the breach with a deafening <em>CLANG</em>.</p>


      <div class="status-header">Part III: Checkmate</div>
  <div class="story-media">
        <img src="z6.png" alt="Elena the flight attendant kissing Zero in the jet cabin">
      </div>
      <p>Zero spun around. The door to the corridor hissed open. He vaulted upward, magnetizing his gloves to the ceiling panels just as a squad of guards stormed in. He crawled along the rafters, dropping into the ventilation shaft just as they swept the floor.</p>

      <p>He navigated the vents to an exterior grate on the 90th floor. He kicked it out and looked down.</p>


      <p>The street below was a sea of flashing blue and red. <strong>The NYPD.</strong></p>

      <p>They were set up for a siege. Barricades blocking the avenues. SWAT vans deploying. And right in the center, standing by a command car, was a figure in a trench coat looking straight up at the tower. <strong>Detective Miller.</strong></p>
     <div class="story-media">
        <img src="z5.png" alt="Aerial view of police lights surrounding the building">
      </div>
      <p>Searchlights swept up the side of the building. Four beams crossed, slicing through the darkness. They were hunting him. If Zero rappelled down, the snipers would pick him off. If he went back inside, the private military contractors would kill him.</p>

      <p>He was a ghost caught in a jar.</p>

      <p>Zero touched the comms unit in his ear.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Shark,"</p>

      <p>Zero whispered, his voice devoid of emotion. "The exit vector is compromised. The equation has changed."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Improvise,"</p>

      <p>The Shark's voice came back, cold and distant.</p>

      <p>Zero looked at the maze of ducts behind him, then at the lethal drop below him. For the first time in his existence, the path forward wasn't a straight line. He checked his oxygen levels. <strong>40%.</strong> He checked his ammo. <strong>Zero.</strong></p>

      <p>He turned back into the darkness of the building.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Understood."</p>
            <div class="story-media">
	          <img src="z7.png" alt="Aerial view of police lights surrounding the building">
      </div>
      <p>He slipped back into the vent, disappearing into the guts of the tower. He didn't know how he was getting out. But he knew one thing: He wasn't going to be zeroed out tonight.</p>
