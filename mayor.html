        January 1, 2026 &bull; The Metropolitan Museum of Art
      </div>

      <p class="drop-cap">The cold air off Central Park was the only honest thing the Mayor of New York had felt all day. He stood near the stone railing, his back to the warmth and the noise of the Great Hall. Inside, three thousand of the city’s elite were drinking champagne to celebrate his victory—a victory most of them had paid to prevent.</p>

      <p>He rubbed his eyes, his fingers brushing against the <strong>thick, dark beard and heavy mustache</strong> he hadn't bothered to trim for the cameras. It was a signature now—a rejection of the clean-shaven, baby-faced politicians who usually stood on this balcony. The weight of the Bible he had placed his hand on earlier that morning still felt heavy on his palm. <em>I, do solemnly swear...</em></p>

      <p class="dialogue">"They say the first day is the hardest,"</p>

      <p>a voice drifted from the shadows. "But that's a lie. The first day is a parade. The <em>second</em> day is when the bill comes due."</p>

      <p>The Mayor didn't turn. He knew the voice. It was the sound of the ticker tape, the closing bell, the margin call.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"I didn't think you'd come,"</p>

      <p>the Mayor said, looking out at the skyline. He adjusted the lapel of his suit—vintage, slightly worn at the elbows, a stark contrast to the bespoke tuxedos inside. "Considering my manifesto explicitly lists your industry as a parasite."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"I love a challenge,"</p>

      <p>the Shark of Wall Street replied, stepping into the moonlight.</p>

      <p>The Shark was dressed in midnight blue, holding a glass of amber liquid with the casual arrogance of a man who owned the distillery. He leaned against the railing, facing the Mayor. Two men, cut from the same distant cloth, standing at the pinnacle of the American Empire.</p>
      
      <div style="margin: 4rem 0; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1);">
        <img src="shark.png" alt="Two Glasses" style="width: 100%; display: block;">
      </div>

      <p class="dialogue">"Congratulations,"</p>

      <p>the Shark said, raising his glass slightly. "You are officially the King of New York. Sworn in, signed, sealed. How does it feel to look down on the kingdom?"</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"I don't look down,"</p>

      <p>the Mayor corrected, his voice quiet but firm, the cadence of a former housing lawyer used to fighting for the displaced. "That’s your vantage point. I look <em>at</em> it."</p>

      <p>The Shark chuckled. "Semantics. You’re a politician now. You trade in words. I trade in reality."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Reality?"</p>

      <p>The Mayor turned, his dark, tired eyes sharpening. "The reality is that while you were drinking scotch in your penthouse this morning, I was in Queens swearing an oath to the people who clean your office. To the people you evict. That oath isn't a formality to me. It’s a debt."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"A debt you can’t pay without my tax revenue,"</p>

      <p>the Shark countered smoothly. "You quote Fanon and talk about 'Radical Dignity,' but you forget where we come from. You forget the history of our own people."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"I forget nothing,"</p>

      <p>the Mayor said. "I know exactly where we come from. We come from a place that was looted by men who thought commerce justified cruelty. You look at the British East India Company and see a business model. I see a warning."</p>

      <p>The Shark paused. The air between them shifted. It wasn't just political anymore; it was philosophical. A clash of two distinct interpretations of survival.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"You see a warning,"</p>

      <p>the Shark mused, swirling his drink. "I see adaptation. The world is a jungle, Mr. Mayor. You can be the tree that gives shade, or you can be the axe. I chose the axe. You chose to be... what? The gardener?"</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"The root,"</p>

      <p>the Mayor said. "Because when the storm comes—and I am <em>bringing</em> the storm—the axe rusts. But the root holds."</p>

      <p>The Shark smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. It was a predator's assessment. He set his glass down on the freezing stone ledge.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"You really believe that,"</p>

      <p>the Shark said softly. "You actually believe you can govern this city with poetry and principles."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"I was sworn in at noon,"</p>

      <p>the Mayor replied. "Watch me."</p>

      <p>The Shark straightened his jacket, the diamonds on his cufflinks catching the city light.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Enjoy your night, Mr. Mayor. Savor the applause,"</p>

      <p>the Shark said, turning to walk back toward the warmth of the party. "Because tomorrow morning, the markets open. And the city doesn't run on oaths. It runs on what I provide."</p>

      <p class="dialogue">"Tomorrow morning,"</p>

      <p>the Mayor called after him, "the rules change."</p>

      <p>The Shark didn't look back. He simply vanished into the crowd, leaving the Mayor alone with the cold, the dark, and the city he had just promised to save.</p>
